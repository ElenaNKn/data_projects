# HR analytics project

## Project description

This project was completed as part of the "Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate" (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics).

The main goals of the project are:
1. to analyze data collected by the HR department;
2. to create a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

The business impact of this project is to reduce costs by increasing employee retention, as it is time-consuming and expensive to recruit, interview, and hire new staff.

The project is performed on the base of dataset ["Hr Analytics Job Prediction"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv)
