# Product Metrics Dashboard

This project uses data from the ["SQL simulator"](https://karpov.courses/simulator-sql).
The goal is to build a dashboard to track product metrics of a delivery service.
The database schema and tables' structure are described [here](database_structure.md)

## Tracked Metrics

The dashboard includes the following metrics:
1. Daily Revenue and Change of Daily Revenue by days; 
2. Total Revenue and Total Costs (cumulative values by days), calculated with different tax coefficients for multiple products;
3. Daily Gross Profit and Gross Profit Ratio:
4. Total Gross Profit and Total Gross Profit Ratio (cumulative values of daily metrics);
5. ARPPPU (Average Revenue per Paying User), ARPU (Average Revenue per User) and AOV (Average Order Value) dynamics by Days;
6. ARPPPU (Average Revenue per Paying User), ARPU (Average Revenue per User) and AOV (Average Order Value) distribution by Weekdays;
7. Running ARPPU, ARPU and AOV by Day (cumulative values by days);
8. Revenue from New Users (showing the share of revenue from new and existing users);
9. Revenue by Products.
